# Operation Jeff

A simple arcade game for the ZX Spectrum Next - Work in progress!

The code can be compiled with `make` and the z88dk toolchain. It is developed using Visual Studio Code.

More details will be added here soon.

### Instructions

Use the mouse to point and shoot. The bolts you fire land and explode shortly later, and will dematerialise any nearby Jeff.

Do not let any Jeff reach the edge of the screen, or you will lose health and eventually the game will be over. Once a certain number of Jeff is eliminated, you move onto the next area.

Shooting uses _charge_ which slowly replenishes over time. You can trade fire rate for charge speed (and the reverse) by using the mouse wheel.

Shoot bonuses for various benefits:
- Red cross: Replenish health
- Green cross: Replenish charge
- Black cross: Bonus points
- Yellow diamond: Smart bomb

If a bolt explodes especially close enough to a Jeff you get a small bonus as well.

Press P to pause during the game.
